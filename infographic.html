					<h1 class="name"> Can Your Salary Balance Your House Value?</h1>
					<p class="description">On a Single Night in January 2014, 578,424 people were homeless in the United States. In the past eight years, the total homeless population in the United States was decreasing. This is undoubtedly a good news. However, the total homelesspopulation in the New York City was increasing constantly. Coincidentally, in most of the largest cities in the United States, the homeless population is actually rising comparing to reduction in the nation wide. This comparison thus raises our question. Why does this situation happen?</p>

					<h1 class="name"> How Much Do You Pay For Your Colonoscopy</h1>
					<p class="description">The cost of a colonoscopy in the United States varies widely, from place to place, and even within a city. The average cost of the colonoscopy in the U.S. is about $1,185. However, in many other developed countries, it only costs a few hundred dollars. So why the prices vary so dramatically from place to place? Do you know what you're paying for?</p>
