                    <p class="main-subtext">Many shark populations are declining worldwide, primarily due to overfishing. For the majority of shark species, no international exploitation limits exists.

                    <p class="main-subtext">Half the reduction in child mortality over the past 40 years can be attributed to the better education of women. For every one-year increase in the average education of reproductive-age women, a country experienced a 9.5 percent decrease in the child deaths. 
                    <br>A mother's education affects her children's health in myriad ways. 
                    <br>Better-educated women are more likely to understand disease-prevention measures such as vaccines and mosquito nets, and to use them. They are more likely to take a sick child to a clinic early and to follow treatment instructions. They are more likely to understand germ theory and set clean water and sanitation as household priorities.

In the past eight years, the total homeless population in the United States was decreasing. This is undoubtedly a good news. However, the total homelesspopulation in the New York City was increasing constantly. Coincidentally, in most of the largest cities in the United States, the homeless population is actually rising comparing to reduction in the nation wide. This comparison thus raises our question. Why does this situation happen?

                    <p class="main-subtext">It is well known that J.K. Rowling made a wonderful job in the Harry Potter series creating a lot of great characters. From Albus Dumbledore to Severus Snape, these âgoodâ guys made themselves heroes in their specific but persuading ways. However, Lord Voldemort, standing on the other side of the book, however âbadâ we know, was just described simply by the very word âbadâ. Abandoned by his own family, having no friends at all, and killing himself twice, Lord Voldemort, must be the poorest bad guy ever. Considering the data collected from the book, did J.K. Rowling create successfully a âbadâ guy that could match the greatness of the justice side?

                    <p class="main-subtext">
                        A colonoscopy is an exam that views the
                        inside of the colon (large intestine) and
                        rectum, using a tool called colonoscope. The
                        colonoscope has a small camera attached to a
                        flexible tube that can reach the length of the colon.<br>
                        The cost of a colonoscopy in the United States varies widely, from place to place, and even within a city. The average cost of the colonoscopy in the U.S. is about $1,185. However, in many other developed countries, it only costs a few hundred dollars. So why the prices vary so dramatically from place to place? Do you know what you're paying for?
